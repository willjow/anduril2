Tasks to do...


- TODO(willjow)
  Replace current "tint shortcut" UI with a stepped mode similar to the stepped
  mode for output ramping.
    - retain 3H/4H to tint ramp, change 5C to toggle stepped/smooth mode
      (basically same UI as output ramping, but with 2 more clicks)
    - replace both the "tint ramp config" and "tint 5C config" menus with the
      stepped/smooth tint toggle menu
        - UI: number of clicks is the number of steps; e.g.
              0C: smooth
              1C: middle only
              2C: ch 1, ch 2
              3C: ch 1, mid, ch2
              .
              :
        - notice that 2C here makes the "tint ramp config" redundant
        - 1C/3C here is acceptably close to the current "tint 5C config"
          functionality
    - it would probably not be very useful to be able to set a tint
      floor/ceiling, so this should be enough


- TODO(willjow)
  Fix blinking when adjusting tint?
    - appears to be correlated with whether we save_config/save_config_wl,
      maybe this is related to having to cli() before writing eeprom???
    - in revision 642, ToyKeeper mentions bug with brightness changing after
      releasing here
        - sounds like a different problem tbh but we could see if calling
          set_level after save_config changes anything
        - or both before and after? lol true spaghett


- TODO(willjow)
  The moving average voltage filter seems to work relatively well, but
  there's still an observable interval in which the leds will oscillate between
  blue and green+blue. OTOH, running the light on turbo for ~15s appeared to
  push the voltage out of this interval so maybe the filter can be considered
  good enough.
    - to improve, perhaps we can implement an smoothing algorithm that captures
      some notion of inertia?
    - explicitly disallowing the voltage reading to increase after detecting
      a cycle doesn't seem like a very clean way to handle this...
        - what happens if the voltage is actually increasing in the case that
          the light has onboard charging?
        - on the other hand this might be necessary if the cycles are in fact
          caused by the voltage drop from the aux leds and not just noise... in
          which case the voltage is truly oscillating


- TODO(willjow)
  Add option to set button led modes independently from aux leds (8C?)
    - (follow aux, off, low, high)


- (DONE) To help people navigate this repository, it would be helpful to either
  re-organize the firmwares by hardware type (switch type, MCU, OTC,
  etc) or somehow tag each of them with relevant hardware requirements.


- (DONE) Similarly, it would be helpful to tag each firmware with its overall
  purpose and/or style.
