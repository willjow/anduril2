Tasks to do...

- (TODO) Fix blinking when adjusting tint?
    - appears to be correlated with whether we save_config/save_config_wl,
      maybe this is related to having to cli() before writing eeprom???
    - in revision 642, ToyKeeper mentions bug with brightness changing after
      releasing here
        - sounds like a different problem tbh but we could see if calling
          set_level after save_config changes anything
        - or both before and after? lol true spaghett

- (TODO) Add option to set button led modes independently from aux leds (8C?)
    - (follow aux, off, low, high)

- (TODO?) If it turns out that the SMA_2 filter doesn't really work for the
  oscillating voltage aux leds, it'll probably be tricky to implement an
  efficient conventional filter that reliably works. Perhaps we can just
  implement a cycle detector and explicitly prevent cycles instead.

- (DONE) To help people navigate this repository, it would be helpful to either
  re-organize the firmwares by hardware type (switch type, MCU, OTC,
  etc) or somehow tag each of them with relevant hardware requirements.

- (DONE) Similarly, it would be helpful to tag each firmware with its overall
  purpose and/or style.
