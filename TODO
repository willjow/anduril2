Tasks to do...

- (TODO) Smooth voltage readings so aux leds on voltage setting don't oscillate
  every ~9 secconds
    Notes:
        - standby() called when go_to_standby is true
            - go_to_standby set by entering off_mode and remains 1 until
              a button is pressed
        - standby aka sleep_until_eswitch_pressed:
            - (assume no buttons are pressed)
            - TICK_DURING_STANDBY every 0.128 ms (vs every 16 ms regularly)
            sets ADC_off()
            while(go_to_standby)
                1. initially wake up on first standby tick - call WDT_inner()
                WDT_inner():
                    emit sleep tick
                    process_emissions()
                        (notably: call rgb_led_update())
                    if not on a multiple of 64 ticks: return
                    else: adc_trigger = 0,
                          ADC_on():
                                set_admux_voltage():
                                    adc_channel = 0
                                    adc_sample_count = 0
                                    ADC_start_measurement()
                          ADC_start_measurement()
                          adc_deferred_enable = 1

                2. when ADC finishes conversion, ISR(ADC_vect):
                    if not measurement:
                        copy measurement into adc_raw, inc/dec adc_smooth

                * (1, 2) occurs twice before any voltage handling happens
                  first cycle should occur just after turning off
                  second cycle should occur 64 ticks later (8.192 s)
                  then:

                3.
                WDT_inner():
                    adc_reset = 1
                    adc_deferred_enable = 1
                    adc_deferred()

                adc_deferred():
                    adc_deferred_enable = 0
                    if (go_to_standby):
                        ADC_off()
                        adc_channel = 0
                    ADC_voltage_handler():
                        if (adc_reset)
                            measurement = adc_raw[0];
                            adc_smooth[0] = measurement;  // no lowpass while asleep
                        }
                        else measurement = adc_smooth[0];
                        set voltage to converted ADC reading
                    adc_reset--

                * repeat entire cycle from beginning (right?)

    - TK doesn't use adc_smooth value when sleeping because response is too
      slow?
        - e.g., turbo => voltage drop, then from off it would take too long for
          this to increment back up to resting voltage?
        - if we implement a moving average window, then we can also just reset
          the window after entering off or lockout


- (TODO) Add interface for turning on a second aux led setting
    - maybe first momentary in lockout? anything else we would get a flash of
      the main emitters beforehand which would kind of defeat its purpose as
      a lower-than-moonlight mode

- (TODO) Fix blinking when adjusting tint?
    - appears to be correlated with whether we save_config/save_config_wl,
      maybe this is related to having to cli() before writing eeprom???

- (TODO) Add option to set button led modes independently from aux leds (8C?)
    - (follow aux, off, low, high)

- (DONE) To help people navigate this repository, it would be helpful to either
  re-organize the firmwares by hardware type (switch type, MCU, OTC,
  etc) or somehow tag each of them with relevant hardware requirements.

- (DONE) Similarly, it would be helpful to tag each firmware with its overall
  purpose and/or style.
