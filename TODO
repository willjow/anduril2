Tasks to do...

- (TODO) Set ramp 4H to tint ramp down

- (TODO) Add ramp config for disabling tint ramp reversing with 3H

- (TODO) Set ramp 5C to go to middle of tint ramp for lights with tint ramping (keep
  as momentary for lights without tint ramp)

- (TODO) Make 4H from lockout observe "ramp up after moon" setting

- (TODO) Smooth voltage readings so aux leds on voltage setting don't oscillate
  every ~9 secconds

- (TODO) Add option to set button led modes independently from aux leds (8C?)
    - (follow aux, off, low, high)

- (DONE) To help people navigate this repository, it would be helpful to either
  re-organize the firmwares by hardware type (switch type, MCU, OTC,
  etc) or somehow tag each of them with relevant hardware requirements.

- (DONE) Similarly, it would be helpful to tag each firmware with its overall
  purpose and/or style.
